## üßπ Data Cleaning (Python)

Raw data was cleaned using `pandas`. Key steps included:

- Converted `Order Date` and `Ship Date` to datetime format
- Removed rows with missing or corrupt dates and postal codes
- Dropped redundant columns like `Row ID`, `Country`, and `Customer Name`
- Created `Year`, `Month`, and `Month-Year` fields for trend analysis
